 What is indentation error? Why indentation is important? Give one simple example?
 '''
 '''
 Indentation error is a kind of error that usually happens when we don't
 leave spaces (generally four spaces or we can achieve it using tab button also)
 in conditionals statements, loops, etc. Indentation is important because it helps
 the program and machine to understand that the subject matter contained under that 
 is sub part of their own or whatever written inside them using indentation is a part
 of them.

 example: 
'''
raining= True
if (raining):
print ("No classes will held today") # This is IndentationError
else:
    ("Classes will held as usual") # This is right way to avoid Indentation errror
